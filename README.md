- 👋 Hi, I’m @aAlexander916
- 👀 I’m interested in coding as a hobby, but also as an opportunity to make a career pivot.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the fundamentals of computer scienace and programming languages. I'm currently (Sprint 2022) enrolled in a community college course about algorithms and design.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment. This will serve to house my programs and code as I go through this journey.
- 📫 How to reach me: search me up on Replit.
